Homeless are hardly aware of the dangers of Coronavirus and the solutions available to fight against it. The current Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak continues to spread, with growing numbers of confirmed cases in India. This makes lakhs of homeless living on the streets with lack of ability to self- quarantine, access to medical care acutely vulnerable.

It is absolutely, entirely appropriate that Oxfam should be investing money to support UK food banks, says its new chief executive, Mark Goldring. He’s aware that some powerful voices argue that aid charities associated with humanitarian disasters in the developing world have no real business operating in the UK, where, it is sometimes suggested, “real” poverty doesn’t exist. But Goldring is unmoved: “It’s really important that we can say our job is to respond to injustice, poverty and suffering, wherever we see it.”

He points out that some of those same voices have in the past criticised Oxfam for caring too much about international poverty and ignoring poor people in the UK (the charity has had UK programmes for the past 20 years). But it is not just grumbling voices from the British rightwing media. When he’s abroad, he says, the locals occasionally question Oxfam’s moral authority: “People say ‘You come here and tell us what to do – so why is it we read about people sleeping in the streets in your own country?’”"/>

While in north Bengal our teams are reaching out to farmers to purchase potatoes in bulk and including these in our local ration kits, in Sunderbans, where our teams had earlier (before the lockdown) worked with the communities to plant kitchen gardens, they are now growing and selling back fresh vegetables to us, which are being added to our local ration kits. Similarly, we have mobilized and supported a community making bamboo baskets, while in Alipore, tribals are engaged in face mask making work. In Kolkata,and also in North Bengal, we are engaging small-time tailors to make face masks for our relief kits but the best story is of a bitter-gourd (karela) growing farmer, who contributed all his produce to Goonj, as a token of help." author="Goonj.org"/>

Every mission to INDIA we visit an old aged and widow’s home.  Pastor Israel, one of our INDIA partners, lovingly cares for these women by providing a home, daily food, blankets, clothing and fellowship.  His mother used to be a part of this ministry before passing away a few years ago.  This has become a very special place for us to visit as we have fond memories of his mom and have gotten to know many of the other women. Even with the language barrier, smiles and hugs knit our hearts together.

After greeting everyone through our translator (Pastor Israel’s youngest daughter, Jennifer), I introduced another team member, Jim, to share a message.  On the drive here, with nothing prepared, we prayed and asked the Holy Spirit to lead us.  I was thankful upon arriving when Jim spoke up and said God had put something on his heart to say.   Jim’s message was powerful as he told the women that their best days are yet to come.  How can you say that to a group of women who are bent over with crippled knees and weathered skin; Women in the last stage of life who have been through so much and are left alone with no other family then each other?  You can say that because they know JESUS!

Stats as per India Times says that 62% of women in India use cloth during menstruation. Which is so unhygienic that it may lead to several diseases. But why is it so? Why women, majorly in rural areas of India are not provided with safe sanitary pads. 

There are 2 possible reasons. 1st, they don’t have enough awareness & 2nd, they cannot afford it.

Sad but true. For some people even necessities are luxury. 

We urge people to donate as much as possible for the charity of sanitary pads."/>
